# 3D Image Processing for a Harvesting Manipulator

Within the EU founded project CROPS, the Institute for Applied Mechanics (AM) has developed an agricultural robot for harvesting several high-quality crops or precision spraying.

Since the goal of the project is an autonomous acting manipulator, a vision system is needed to detect fruits and obstacles within the work space. The main task of this project was to implement a fast and robust PCL-based module in order to overcome the aforementioned problem.
